// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

A(1). Divide the number in question (Num1) by 2. 
 (2). If the result of Step A(1) is an integer, Num1 is even. Otherwise, Num1 is odd. 


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A(1). Create a list of five numbers (num1, num2, num3, num4, num5).
B(1). Calculate the sum of the 5 numbers in the list.
 (2). Divide the sum from Step B(1) by 5 to return the mean.
C(1). Arrange the list in ascending order.
 (2). Choose the first number in the list; this is the minimum number.
 (3). Choose the last number in the list; this is the maximum number.
D(1). Print "List mean:" followed by result of Step B(2).
 (2). Print "Smallest number in list:" followed by result of Step C(2).  
 (3). Print "Largest number in list:" followed by result of Step C(3).
